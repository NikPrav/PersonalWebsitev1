This is a blog/website that i've been meaning to create for ages. Treat this as a way to just put out whatever I'm learning throughout my time in college and in industry, just in case I forget that I learnt something :p

# Topics
To get an overview of what I've learnt in college, go to 
- [[Overview - Fall23|Overview - Fall23]]
- [[Overview - Spring 24]]

I have recently been exploring Verification, so as to find methods for automating it. My exploration on Verification has been detailed out in [[Overview - Verification]]

I have been reading a lot of papers as a result of lit surveys and various courses, hopefully I should be able to update them on this website soon.

I plan on setting up a place for my hobbies, mainly photography, which should happen as soon as i get time to upload pics (read: never).
